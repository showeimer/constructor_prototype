#Constructor and Prototype Practice

In this project, you will work on creating constructors and prototypes that will help pass a series of pre-written tests.

##Instructions

There will be a series of console statements that you need to make pass in the main.js file. You may not edit the testing functions or the test statements in the tests.js file. It will help to view the tests.js file to take a look at the tests that are running.

You'll be required to write some code in both the Dog and Human constructor as well as create the instances listed with the correct properties.
